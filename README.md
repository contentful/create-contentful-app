This project makes it easy to bootstrap [Contentful Apps](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/app-framework/) with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Forma 36](https://f36.contentful.com/) (Contentful's design system).

## Requirements

- Node.js v14 or v16
- NPM v6 or v7

# Quick Overview

To start developing your app:

```
npx @contentful/create-contentful-app init my-first-app
cd my-first-app
npm start
```

To use your app, you need to create an [app definition](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/#/reference/app-definitions):

```
npx @contentful/create-contentful-app create-definition
```
